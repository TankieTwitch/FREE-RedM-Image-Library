# How to use The Icon Library Project Resource

> [!NOTE] 
> This library will no longer be added to as it has been moved to Tebex. For future updates please visit TILP Discord.

This is a brief tutorial on how to use the libraries with your server. This Library is free to use and is added to frequently. 
If you would like to use for creating scripts for use with RedM, I would be thankful for a link back to this repository.

1. Download the library of your choice and keep it in a separate area on your computer. You will replace this folder every time that library is updated.

2. Add the image you want to use to your server image folder OR the script folder if that is where the image files you wish to replace are located.

3. Name the icon image so it correspond to the image you are replacing or the name you have entered in the database you are adding them to - the .png name MUST match the name of the item in your script and database (I'm not a code person, but I know it is case sensitive so make sure they match)

### **PLEASE NOTE:**
Updates will include changelogs so if you are using a current image and it's updated in the library by name - this won't affect your scrips as long as you are not pulling ***directly*** from the main library folder on your computer. Please don't do that.

* If you like the library and would like to support it, please consider making a donation to my [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/theiconlibraryproject)

# REDM LIBRARY RESOURCE
<br/>

**RedM** - The RedM folder has been broken down into folders to make it easier to search by categories 

> [!CAUTION]
> The names of .pngs in the library can change without warning. File naming is based on my system. Best practice is to save a copy of the library on you desktop. IF an images gets updated it will be indicated in the changelog notes.
